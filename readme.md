# Parcel Template

This setup can be used for developing any project using basically HTML, CSS or SCSS & JS.

### Install

To install only use the command `yarn` or `npm install`

### Dev

To init parcel dev mode use command `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

---

If you want to use SCSS you only need to change the file linked to your HTML from `.css` to `.scss` and begin to write SCSS styles. Parcel do everything.
